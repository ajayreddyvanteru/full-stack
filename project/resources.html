          Supermarket, large retail store operated on a self-service basis, selling groceries,
           fresh produce, meat, bakery and dairy products, and sometimes an assortment of nonfood goods.
          Supermarkets gained acceptance in the United States during the 1930s. The early stores were usually
           located in reconverted industrial buildings in outlying areas; they had no elaborate display
            facilities, and their primary advantage was their low prices. During the 1940s and â€™50s, they
             became the major food-marketing channel in the United States, and in the 1950s they spread
              through much of Europe. The extent to which they have succeeded in various countries has depended on 
              the ability or willingness of producers and wholesalers to adapt their operations to large-scale retailing.
               The spread of supermarkets has been part of a trend in the developed countries toward reducing costs and 
               simplifying the pattern of marketing.
